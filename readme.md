This Matlab toolbox implements some techniques for SPD matrices. The following techniques are available:

 - SPD-COV:  	compute covariance on the SPD manifold    
 - SPD-LDV: 	compute Riemannian local difference vectors on the SPD manifold   
 - SPD-Means:	compute Riemannian means on the SPD manifold   
 - SPD-Metrics:	compute geodesic distances on the SPD manifold
